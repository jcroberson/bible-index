# Bible Index
Bible index is a personal project built during my free time as an exercise to get better at coding and to use as a tool for Bible study. It it written in python using the eel module to make the UI in html and css. 

!! A warning, the bp.py code is currently configured to run in firefox !!

The GUI is shown below.
